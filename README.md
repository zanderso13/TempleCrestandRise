# TempleCrestandRise

This repository contains code related to collaborations with Dr. Lauren Alloy at Temple University. Both grants focus in on reward processing at a variety of age groups. 
Their team will collect data that  will be transferred and processed at Northwestern University
Scripts in the repository will deal with data transfer including:
1. Globus from personal endpoint to NU server
2. Initial organization of data into a structure that bidskit will recognize
3. (Bidskit is installed on the server but that would go here)
4. Preprocessing  with fMRIprep

Next, this repository will include analysis scripts for future work. Nothing here yet but will be soon
